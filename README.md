# Deprecation

BigNgine hasn't turned out how we wanted. When we started this project, we were inexperienced and learnt a lot while working on it.
We aim to make BigNgine 2 in Rust, but that's a plan for a far future. For now, we recommend the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine.

## Technologies

To run this project, you're going to need:

- Windows operating system (we use dlls)
- make
- clang
- c++ std libraries (clang doesn't have them by default)

## Makefile

- `make / make output` to compile
- `make run` to run
- `make clean` to delete the obj files and the build
- `make build_and_run` to compile and then run
- `make all` to compile without using .o files

## Contribution

We welcome all contributors to BigNgine. If you want to contribute, take a look at our [trello page](https://trello.com/b/QMKhWjB4/bigngine). If you have your own idea on how BigNgine should change or develop, you can write an email to **dawidekpe@gmail.com** (please don't spam). We will try to respond to all emails we receive.

## Documentation

All the functionalities should be well documented in code. We plan on creating a BigNgine website, which will contain an actual documentation.

## Usage

For now, we recommend not using BigNgine for game development, as it is not yet finished.
